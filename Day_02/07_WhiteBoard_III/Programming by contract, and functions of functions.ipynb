    "There is a lot to PBC; it is an extensive paradigm and it is not fully implemented in Python. But Python supports one of its key elements: assertions. Assertions establish what the system's state must be at a particular place in the code. An assertion that prescribes the state of the system before a code body executes is called a $\\bf precondition$. An assertion that prescribes the system state after a function executes is called a $\\bf postcondition$. An assertion that prescribes the system state while a function executes is called an $\\bf invariant$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding preconditions and postconditions to your functions provides a contract with your user. The user promises to abide by the preconditions and thus your function knows the domains of its arguments. Your function promises to abide by the postconditions, which informs the user of your function's effect on the system state. In principle, code can be $\\it proven$ correct using assertions like these. In practice, it is a powerful debugging and documentation tool."
